For the “0. Island Perimeter” project, you will need to apply your knowledge of algorithms, data structures (specifically matrices or 2D lists), and iterative or conditional logic to solve a geometric problem within a grid context. The goal is to calculate the perimeter of a single island in a grid, where the grid is represented by a 2D array of integers. Understanding how to navigate and analyze 2D arrays and apply logical operations to determine the conditions for perimeter calculation is crucial for this task.
